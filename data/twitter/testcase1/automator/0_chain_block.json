        "content": "I will give you a list of blocks in the UI, is any of them related to the task \"Follow Elon Musk\"? If yes, which block is the most related to complete the task?\n[Block 0]:[Not Scrollable] This UI element represents the toolbar of the Twitter Android app. It contains two clickable components: a navigation drawer button and the Twitter logo. Tapping the navigation drawer button will reveal the app's side menu, while tapping the Twitter logo will take the user back to the app's home screen. This toolbar is a consistent UI element across most screens in the Twitter app, providing easy access to its core functionalities.\n[Block 1]:[Scrollable] This code snippet describes a UI screen for the Twitter Android application. The screen features a paginated view that includes a horizontal scrollable tab layout with one \"For You\" and one \"Following\" option. Underneath, there is a scrollable list of tweets, each including information about the user who posted it, the content of the tweet, and actions that can be taken, such as replying, retweeting, liking, viewing view counts, and sharing. Each tweet also includes the number of views, comments, and likes.\n[Block 2]:[Not Scrollable] This code snippet describes a UI element with the class \"ViewGroup\" that contains a child element with the resource ID \"twitter.android:id/composer_write\". This child element is an image button with a clickable attribute set to \"True\" and an ID of 73. The button's description is \"New Tweet\". From this, we can infer that the UI element represents a button that allows the user to create a new tweet within the Twitter app.\n[Block 3]:[Not Scrollable] This code snippet is a description of a UI element in the Twitter Android app that consists of a horizontal scroll view with tabs for different channels. The channels include: search, spaces, notifications, and direct messages. Each channel is represented by a clickable view with a unique resource ID and description. The search channel allows users to search for content on Twitter, spaces to view and join audio chat rooms, notifications to view and manage notifications, and direct messages to view and send private messages to other users.\n\n Answer [Yes] with the most related block if any or [No] if not."
